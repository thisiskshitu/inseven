            Welcome to InSeven. Choose a number from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and the computer
            will guess your number in a maximum of 7 steps
            <br><br>
            At each step computer will ask you whether your number
            was this and you have to tell the computer whether his
            guess was low or high
            <br><br>
            For example if your number is 14 and the computer asked
            whether your number was 50 then press the high button to tell
            the computer that his guess was higher than your number and 
            vice versa if for example your number was 70 and the computer
            guess was 50 then press the low button to tell the computer that
            his guess was lower than your number
            <br><br>
            Press the button Yes! when the computer has guessed your number correctly
            <br><br>
            The steps counter is always present below the buttons to show how many
            steps the computer took to guess your number
            <br><br>
